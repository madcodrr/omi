## Building and Flashing

### Prerequisites

1. **PlatformIO** installed in VS Code or as CLI
2. **ESP32 development environment** set up
3. **M5Stack Atom Echo** device

### Build Steps

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the firmware directory:
   ```bash
   cd omiGlass/firmware-m5stack-atom-echo/
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pio lib install
   ```

3. Build the firmware:
   ```bash
   pio run -e m5stack_atom_echo
   ```

4. Flash to device:
   ```bash
   pio run -e m5stack_atom_echo -t upload
   ```

### Monitor Serial Output

```bash
pio device monitor -b 115200
```

## BLE Protocol

The firmware implements the OMI BLE protocol with the following services:

### OMI Service (`19B10000-E8F2-537E-4F6C-D104768A1214`)
- **Audio Data** (`19B10001-E8F2-537E-4F6C-D104768A1214`): Streaming audio data
- **Audio Control** (`19B10002-E8F2-537E-4F6C-D104768A1214`): Control commands

### Battery Service (`0x180F`)
- **Battery Level** (`0x2A19`): Current battery percentage

### Device Information Service (`0x180A`)
- Manufacturer name, model, firmware version, hardware revision

## Audio Control Commands

Send these values to the Audio Control characteristic:

| Command | Value | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Start Recording | `1` | Begin audio capture |
| Stop Recording | `0` | Stop audio capture |
| Toggle Recording | `2` | Toggle recording state |
| Enter Power Save | `10` | Reduce power consumption |
| Exit Power Save | `11` | Resume normal operation |

## Configuration

Key configuration options in `src/config.h`:

```cpp
// Audio Settings
#define AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE 16000     // 16kHz sample rate
#define AUDIO_BITS_PER_SAMPLE 16    // 16-bit audio
#define AUDIO_CHANNELS 1            // Mono audio

// Power Management
#define MAX_CPU_FREQ_MHZ 240        // Maximum CPU frequency
#define MIN_CPU_FREQ_MHZ 80         // Minimum for stable I2S
#define IDLE_THRESHOLD_MS 45000     // Power save after 45s idle

// LED Settings
#define LED_BRIGHTNESS 50           // RGB LED brightness (0-255)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No audio capture**: Check I2S pin connections and microphone power
2. **BLE not advertising**: Restart device, check for BLE conflicts
3. **LED not working**: Verify RGB LED pin (G27) and power supply
4. **Button not responsive**: Check GPIO39 connection and pull-up resistor

### Debug Output

Enable debug output by setting `CORE_DEBUG_LEVEL=5` in `platformio.ini`:

```ini
build_flags = 
    -DCORE_DEBUG_LEVEL=5
```

### Serial Monitor Commands

Monitor the serial output for debug information:
- I2S initialization status
- BLE connection events
- Audio buffer statistics
- Power management state changes

## Development

### Code Structure

```
